# A simple todo app

This todo app has been made with vue.js and node.js using a mongo database. 
It was a project made to be deployed on [heroku] (https://www.heroku.com/)

## Prerequisites 

You need to sign up for a Heroku account if you don't already have one.

You also need node.js with npm and also yarn.

To install yarn just do:
`npm install -g yarn`

Then you can get the required node_modules :
`yarn install`

Build the code (don't forget to change the envexample file in .env file) :
`yarn build`

Enjoy !
